# AWS CloudFormation Template to create a VPC, EC2, ASG and ALB

This CloudFormation template deploys a robust network architecture on AWS following the best practice. It includes a VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The template also sets up the necessary security groups for the EC2 instances and the ALB.

## 1. Description

This template performs the following tasks:
- Creates a VPC with the specified CIDR bloc.
- Sets up two Availability Zones (AZs) with public and private subnets in each AZ.
- Deploys an Internet Gateway for internet access in public subnets.
- Configures NAT Gateways in each AZ for outbound internet access from private subnets.
- Creates public and private route tables with the routing rules for the traffic.
- Create an Auto Scaling Group which will Launch two EC2 instances in private subnets with a simple web page displaying the instance's AZ.
- Sets up an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic between the EC2 instances.
- Creates the necessary security groups for the EC2 instances and the ALB.

## 2. Parameters

The template accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Type | Default |
|-----------|-------------|------|---------|
| `ProjectName` | The project name that is prefixed to resource names | String | WebApp |
| `VpcCIDR` | The IP range (CIDR notation) for the VPC | String | 10.0.0.0/16 |
| `PublicSubnet1CIDR` | The IP range (CIDR notation) for the public subnet in the first Availability Zone | String | 10.0.1.0/24 |
| `PrivateSubnet1CIDR` | The IP range (CIDR notation) for the private subnet in the first Availability Zone | String | 10.0.2.0/24 |
| `PublicSubnet2CIDR` | The IP range (CIDR notation) for the public subnet in the second Availability Zone | String | 10.0.3.0/24 |
| `PrivateSubnet2CIDR` | The IP range (CIDR notation) for the private subnet in the second Availability Zone | String | 10.0.4.0/24 |

## 3. Resources

The template creates the following resources:

- **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud with the specified CIDR block.
- **Subnets**: Public and private subnets in each of the two Availability Zones for high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Internet Gateway**: An Internet Gateway for internet access in public subnets.
- **NAT Gateways**: NAT Gateways with assigned Elastic IP in each AZ for outbound internet access from private subnets.
- **Public Route table**: Public route table to define the routing rules for the traffic in the public subnet.
- **Private Route table**: Private route table in each AZ to define the routing rules for the traffic in the private subnet.
- **Auto Scaling Group**: An ASG that will launch two EC2 instances in private subnets and  maintain the desired number of EC2 instances depending on the load. 
- **EC2 instance**: Each EC2 instance launched by the ASG will run a simple web server to display the current availability zone.
- **Application Load Balancer**: An ALB in the public subnet to distribute the traffic between the EC2 instances.
- **Security Groups**: Security groups as firewall to control the network access to the EC2 instances and the ALB.

All the resources are tagged with the project name to easily identify them in the AWS Management Console and for billing purposes.

## 4. Outputs

The template provides the following outputs:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `LoadBalancerDNSName` | The DNS name of the Application Load Balancer |

## 5. Usage

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of AWS services
- For CLI method: AWS CLI installed and configured

### 5.1 Deploying the Template

You can deploy this CloudFormation template using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.

#### 5.1.1 AWS Management Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
3. Click on "Create stack" and select "Choose an existing template".
4. Upload the template file or specify the S3 URL where the template is stored.
5. Provide the stack name and the required parameters and click "Next".
6. Follow the prompts to complete the stack creation.
7. Navigate through the different tabs of the stack to view the creation status, events, resources, outputs...

#### 5.1.2 AWS CLI

From the root of the project, you can run the following command to create the stack:

```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name web-app-stack --template-body file://template/vpc-ec2-asg-elb.yaml --parameters ParameterKey=ProjectName,ParameterValue=WebApp ParameterKey=VpcCIDR,ParameterValue=10.0.0.0/16 ParameterKey=PublicSubnet1CIDR,ParameterValue=10.0.1.0/24 ParameterKey=PrivateSubnet1CIDR,ParameterValue=10.0.2.0/24 ParameterKey=PublicSubnet2CIDR,ParameterValue=10.0.3.0/24 ParameterKey=PrivateSubnet2CIDR,ParameterValue=10.0.4.0/24
```

To check the status of the stack, you can run the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name web-app-stack
```

To update the stack after a modification, you can run the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name web-app-stack --template-body file://template/vpc-ec2-asg-elb.yaml
```

To list the resources of the stack, you can run the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation list-stack-resources --stack-name web-app-stack
```

Use the following command to get the DNS name

```sh
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name web-app-stack --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='LoadBalancerDNSName'].OutputValue" --output text
```

### 5.2 Testing the Application

#### 5.2.1 Application Load Balancer

After the stack is created, you can access the web application using the DNS name of the Application Load Balancer, which is provided in the stack outputs. You can just open the URL with your browser. By clicking many times, you can see that the availability zone that is displayed is alternating.
This shows the load balancer is effectively load balancing across both EC2 instances across two availability zones.

#### 5.2.2 Auto Scaling Group

After the stack is created, the ASG will launch two instances. When you stop or terminate one instance, the ASG will automatically replace it to maintain the desired capacity.

### 5.3 Deleting the stack

You can delete this CloudFormation stack including all the created resources using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.

#### 5.3.1 AWS Management Console

1. Open the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the CloudFormation service.
3. Click on "Stacks" and select your stack.
4. Click on "Delete" and confirm the deletion

#### 5.3.2 AWS CLI
You can run the following command to delete the stack:

```sh
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name web-app-stack
```
